## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- The Service Oriented Architecture is a web application and an idea paradigm in computer program design in which application software components provide services to other components.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
*Standardized Service Contracts - It is a software design principle used within the service-oriented design paradigm to ensure that service contracts within a service inventory are satisfied.
 *Loose Coupling - It helps to reduce the impact of service changes on consumers so the reusability improves the design and development process.
 *Abstraction- The technological basis of a service is hidden from the consumer and the technology is also used with abstraction.
 *Service Reusability - It is a software design principle so the logic it divides into services with the intent of maximizing reuse.
 *Autonomy - It is services to have control the logic they encapsulate and the ability of a service to follow its logic regardless of factors outside its control.
 *Statelessness - It is design strategy isÂ used within the service-oriented design paradigm to create services that can grow by separating them from their state data as much as possible.
 *Discoverability - Itsupports reusability and needs that services be published in a way that allows them to be easily located which is discovered for later reuse.
 *Composability - It is design used in service oriented to support the creation of services that can be reused in different ways that are made up of composed services.
 *Interoperability - It is important principle in SOA so it allows different distributed web services to operate on many softwares systems and hardware architectures.
3. Define Microservices.
- It is a kind of application architecture in which the applications is developed as a collection of services and it provides the framework to develop, deploy and maintain microservices architecture diagrams etc.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
 *Independently deployable - it is the idea that we may make changes to a microservice and deploy it into a production environment without using any other services.
 *Right tool for the job - It is the architecture  patterns an application typically shares a common stack with a large and it is the relational database to support the entire application.
 *Precise scaling - In Microservices architecture makes it possible for simpler and focused scaling. Each microservice is an independent entity with its own set of rules and responsibilities.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
*Reuse - The main objective is integration reuse, and at the level of the company, striving for some kind of reuse is critical.
*Synchronous calls - In a microservices architecture, synchronous calls introduce real-time dependencies, limiting reliability and resilience.
*Data duplication - In this architecture it is multiple front-facing application use the same SOA services but microservices take a different approach, they apply data duplication instead of sharing common resources.
*Communication - Microservices use simplified messaging mechanisms, such as APIs, which are language independent and allow for faster communication.
*Interoperability - If we need to interface with past technology or other parties using standard protocols, SOA may be the better choice.
*Service granularity - As microservices are more compact, individual services excel at completing a single unique task.
*Speed - It is the advantage of sharing a common architecture which SOA can simplify development and can troubleshoot.
