## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- The Service Oriented Architecture is a web application and an idea paradigm in computer program design in which application software components provide services to other components.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
*Standardized Service Contracts - It is a software design principle used within the service-oriented design paradigm to ensure that service contracts within a service inventory are satisfied.
 *Loose Coupling - It helps to reduce the impact of service changes on consumers so the reusability improves the design and development process.
 *Abstraction- The technological basis of a service is hidden from the consumer and the technology is also used with abstraction.
 *Service Reusability - It is a software design principle so the logic it divides into services with the intent of maximizing reuse.
 *Autonomy - It is services to have control the logic they encapsulate and the ability of a service to follow its logic regardless of factors outside its control.
 *Statelessness - It is design strategy is used within the service-oriented design paradigm to create services that can grow by separating them from their state data as much as possible.
 *Discoverability - Itsupports reusability and needs that services be published in a way that allows them to be easily located which is discovered for later reuse.
 *Composability - It is design used in service oriented to support the creation of services that can be reused in different ways that are made up of composed services.
 *Interoperability - It is important principle in SOA so it allows different distributed web services to operate on many softwares systems and hardware architectures.
3. Define Microservices.
- It is a kind of application architecture in which the applications is developed as a collection of services and it provides the framework to develop, deploy and maintain microservices architecture diagrams etc.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
 *Independently deployable - it is the idea that we may make changes to a microservice and deploy it into a production environment without using any other services.
 *Right tool for the job - It is the architecture  patterns an application typically shares a common stack with a large and it is the relational database to support the entire application.
 *Precise scaling - In Microservices architecture makes it possible for simpler and focused scaling. Each microservice is an independent entity with its own set of rules and responsibilities.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
*Reuse - The main objective is integration reuse, and at the level of the company, striving for some kind of reuse is critical.
*Synchronous calls - In a microservices architecture, synchronous calls introduce real-time dependencies, limiting reliability and resilience.
*Data duplication - In this architecture it is multiple front-facing application use the same SOA services but microservices take a different approach, they apply data duplication instead of sharing common resources.
*Communication - Microservices use simplified messaging mechanisms, such as APIs, which are language independent and allow for faster communication.
*Interoperability - If we need to interface with past technology or other parties using standard protocols, SOA may be the better choice.
*Service granularity - As microservices are more compact, individual services excel at completing a single unique task.
*Speed - It is the advantage of sharing a common architecture which SOA can simplify development and can troubleshoot.
6. Define Web Services
- It is a software system that can function through a network or communicate and exchange data with other software systems.
7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services 
*Exposing the existing function on the network- If a code already exists over the network, it enables the user to utilize that functionalit and the permits other applications to utilize your program's functionality as well.
*Interoperability - It is ability of a system and application to automatically and securely exchange data is known as interoperability. Systems cannot interpret or use data to achieve common goals without interoperability.
*Standardized Protocol- It is web services have standardized protocol because it focuses on protocol rather than implementations. Standardized protocol is a term for a set of rules and principles that specify how various software systems and functions can connect with one another over a network.
*Low Cost Communication - It is a low-cost internet implementation of web services because it is a lightweight protocol used to create web APIs and for exchanging structured information.
8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services 
* XML-Based -  It is a markup language used for encoding documents in a machine- and human-readable format.
*Loosely Coupled - It is degree of interdependence among different parts of the system and web services can vary over time without requiring the client to make arrangements to be able to interact with the service.
*Coarse-Grained - It is a Java method that exposes services individually. Compared to fine-grained services, coarse-grained web services are intended to have broader functionality.
*Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous - An asynchronous method is called by the client. After receiving the request, the asynchronous web service notifies the initiating client through a message and begins processing the request.
*Supports Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) - It is a software communication protocol that allows a program running on one computer connected to a network to request a service from another program running on another computer without needing to know the specifics of the network.
*Supports Document Exchange - It is a web services help document exchange by representing data in XML in a generic manner. This improves data integration and allows applications to share and collaborate on data.
9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture
*Provider - It is develops a web service and provides it to applications or client applications that plan to use it
*Requestor - It is a service request can be made through a client application or a web browser.
*Broker - It is a program that gives the client application access to UDDI so it can use web services.
*Publish - It is uses the service registries publish interface to notify the broker or the service registry about what is happening in the web service. 
*Find - It is the procedure as a service requester asks for the service registration where the service offered by the service provider is located.
*Bind - It is a collection of service providers and requesters that includes the calling parameter, transport protocol, security requirements, and service accessing path.
10. List and discuss the web services components
*SOAP - The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) for web services employs XML as the payload or request body. Platform and language independence are maintained by the XML, which carries all requests and responses.
*WSDL - It is very helpful in web services because it indicates the location of the web service that will be retrieved upon request. It also provides navigation for users to access services, both personally and through other businesses.
*UDDI - In Web services are the UNIVERSAL DESCRIPTION DISCOVERY and INTEFGREATION they are supplied by a service provider, and their interface is described using WSDL.
